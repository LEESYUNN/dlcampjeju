            <h2>What are we doing during the one month program?</h2>
            <p>Basically, we design a deep learning model and fully implement using TensorFlow. It is also possible to (re) implement a published paper (by others) and adapt it for new datasets. Based on this, each participants will propose their own plans in their application.</p>
